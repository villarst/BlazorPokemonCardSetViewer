Steps to certify WSL (Windows Sub-System for Linux) on Brave's Trusted Store

    1.  Run the following commands: "dotnet dev-certs https --clean" along with "dotnet dev-certs https --trust".
            This will clean the developer certifications and then go ahead and trust the newly created one.

    2.  Run the following command to export the pem certificate file: "dotnet dev-certs https -ep ~/.aspnet/https/dev-cert.pem --format PEM --no-password"
            If the file does not exist check with "ls -la ~/.aspnet/https/" then force export it with the --force
            option "dotnet dev-certs https -ep ~/.aspnet/https/dev-cert.pem --format PEM --no-password --force" at the end.

    3.  Next, install the libnss3 tools which will include more network security service libraries that go on top of the set of default Network Security
            Service(NSS) libraries. Run "sudo apt install libnss3-tools"

    4.  Check if the cert9.db, key4.db, and pkcs11.txt files are present in the "HOME/.pki/nssdb/" folder running "ls -la $HOME/.pki/nssdb/".
            If they do exis, add the certificate by running "certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n "dotnet-dev-cert" -i ~/.aspnet/https/dev-cert.pem".

            If no directory exists, run these two commands to create the folder, then the files "mkdir -p $HOME/.pki/nssdbc", "certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -N --empty-password".
            Run the command this command "certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n "dotnet-dev-cert" -i ~/.aspnet/https/dev-cert.pem" to add the developer certificate.

    5. Close Brave, and launch application in Debug Mode to verify that the application is now trusted and teh "Your connection is not private" message is now gone.
