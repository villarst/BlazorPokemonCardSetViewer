Create sets page with information.

Add new sets and cards into Database!

Disable scrolling in the background when clicking a pokemon set.

Need to implement "set" filter for the cards to select which set to show in the cards page.

Need to somehow have it so when you go into the sets page, you click a set to "view cards" and the filtered cards for
that set will appeared.

Maybe add a loading page? loading states? Or something to let the user know that data will appear on the page?
